# CodeCademy-Random-Messages
This is my interpretation of the project "Mixed Messages" from Code Cademy

#Code Functionality: 
I was thinking about video games and D&D and thought maybe do something with luck and dmg, so the way it works is it reandomly selects your luck (Extremely good - Extremely Bad). from then it randomly selects the amount of damage you take and how many times you are hit with that damage. the only stipulation is that if you have extremely good luck you dodge all attacks taking 0 damage.
